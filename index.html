            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>By comissioning me you accept everything here stated.</p>
            <p>Commissions might take around 1 week since I start them, although the ones with numerous characters or specially complex my take more time than expected. You will be informed if that's the case.</p>
            <p>Comissions are not started as soon as they are taken. I might be busy with another project or commission. Please, be patient. You will be informed of around when I'll be able to start your commission, and you'll be informed as soon as I start it.</p>
            <p>All my art is signed, but when you commission me you will receive a version of the piece without watermark. You will not erase my sign, and when sharing it publicly you will credit me.</p>
            <p>Payments are made via Paypal, completely upfront.</p>
            <p>By default, I will share your commission on my Twitter and Ko-Fi publicly. If you don't wish for that to happen, let me know.</p>
            <p>I reserve to myself the right of rejecting or cancelling a commission at any time without explanation. In case of cancelling, you will receive your money back.</p>
            <p>My commissions are for personal use only, such as character art, headers and profile pictures. If my art is going to end up using in something like a stream, I must be properly credited at all times my art is on screen.</p>
            <p>I do not consent for my art to be used for NFTs or generative AI training.</p>
            <p>All communications will be done through Twitter DM. You will receive regular updates on the work and I won't progress on it until I receive an "Okay" or instructions to change something. If the art ends up being delayed because you failed to answer in time, it's not on me.</p>
            <p>Revisions and changes can be done at any stage of the commission until the piece is finished. Once it's finished, it cannot be changed.</p>
            <p>Once I'm at the rendering and detailing phase of the commission, I will only accept revisions regarding the rendering and detailing. I will not move into this phase unless I know the base of the art is completely accepted.</p>
            <p>Once finished, you will be sent an original version of the piece on its original resolution (usually 150x150 px) and a version upscaled by 10 (usually 1500x1500 px).</p>
